			<p><img src="me.jpg" alt="Prom, 2016" title="Me at senior prom, 2016" width="177" height="294.3" align="right"/>I am a Computer Science major at Worcester Polytechnic Institute, on track for a Bachelors of Science Degree, with a strong interest in pursuing cyber security. I am currently a Sophomore and on track to graduate in May of 2020. </p> 
			<p>Throughout my life, I have had a passion for computers, following in the steps of my father. Computers have always been a big part of my life, and figuring out how they and the software works has been an interest of mine since I was a child. I did not begin programming until my senior year of high school, but I always have known I have wanted to do it.</p>
			<p>Alongside my interest in computers, I also have a strong interest in video production and film. For just about the same time I found myself interested in computers, I found myself interested in making videos. I have been producing videos for most of my life, and utilized that skill throughout high school, being a part of the daily morning news team and winning several awards for my journalism stories.</p>
