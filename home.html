			<p>Welcome to my website! This site is a constant work in progress, as I expand further into testing new elements. This website is currently composed of HTML and CSS, with PHP integration currently in the works. Here is where I will keep a log of every big change that occurs on the site.</p>
			<p>---------------------------------------</p>
			<p>UPDATE 2:</p>
			<p>		Just about finished about and programming pages. Will look into video production page at a later time. All hyperlinks should work, as well as link with resume.pdf</p>
			<p>---------------------------------------</p>
			<p>UPDATE 1:</p>
			<p>		As of 2/17/2018, website is up and running at djsullivan.tk. Domain name was received from <a href="https://my.freenom.com/clientarea.php" type="_blank">freenom.com</a>, with website being hosted from <a href="https://www.000webhost.com/" type="_blank">000webhost.com</a>, whos website looks super sketchy, but it works. Since it is a free hosting site, my website is scheduled to be inactive from 12am to 1pm. Looking into making it at a more conveinient time (ie 3am-4am?).</p>
			<p>---------------------------------------</p>
			<p>UPDATE 0:</p>
			<p>		Website base code created. Made in all HTML and CSS. Cannot figure out PHP page and how to send e-mails through it. Will look into it in future.</p>

			<p><img src="me.jpg" alt="Prom, 2016" title="Me at senior prom, 2016" width="177" height="294.3" align="right"/>I am a Computer Science major at Worcester Polytechnic Institute, on track for a Bachelors of Science Degree, with a strong interest in pursuing cyber security or software engineering. I am currently a Sophomore and on track to graduate in May of 2020. </p> 
			<p>Throughout my life, I have had a passion for computers, following in the steps of my father. Computers have always been a big part of my life, and figuring out how they and the software works has been an interest of mine since I was a child. I did not begin programming until my senior year of high school, but I always have known I have wanted to do it.</p>
			<p>Alongside my interest in computers, I also have a strong interest in video production and film. For just about the same time I found myself interested in computers, I found myself interested in making videos. I have been producing videos for most of my life, and utilized that skill throughout high school, being a part of the daily morning news team and winning several awards for my journalism stories.</p>
