			<p>Welcome to my website! This site is a constant work in progress, as I expand further into testing new elements. This website is currently composed of HTML and CSS, with PHP integration currently in the works. Here is where I will keep a log of every big change that occurs on the site.</p>
			<p>---------------------------------------</p>
			<p><b>UPDATE 4:</b></p>
			<p>		Changing name of tab for Video Production to Video to prevent formatting errors across other devices. Added embeded videos to the video tab. Added to the About page.</p>
			<p>---------------------------------------</p>
			<p><b>UPDATE 3:</b></p>
			<p>		Experimenting with fonts so that no formatting gets messed up across platforms. Possibly look into coding a mobile version. Starting to work on video production tab.</p>
			<p>---------------------------------------</p>
			<p><b>UPDATE 2:</b></p>
			<p>		Just about finished about and programming pages. Will look into video production page at a later time. All hyperlinks should work, as well as link with resume.pdf</p>
			<p>---------------------------------------</p>
			<p><b>UPDATE 1:</b></p>
			<p>		As of 2/17/2018, website is up and running at djsullivan.tk. Domain name was received from <a href="https://my.freenom.com/clientarea.php" type="_blank">freenom.com</a>, with website being hosted from <a href="https://www.000webhost.com/" type="_blank">000webhost.com</a>, whose website looks super sketchy, but it works. Since it is a free hosting site, my website is scheduled to be inactive from 12am to 1pm. Looking into making it at a more conveinient time (ie 3am-4am?).</p>
			<p>---------------------------------------</p>
			<p><b>UPDATE 0:</b></p>
			<p>		Website base code created. Made in all HTML and CSS. Cannot figure out PHP page and how to send e-mails through it. Will look into it in future.</p>

			<h1><u><center>Video Production</center></u></h1>
			<p>In high school, I heavily participated in the school's television program. I have always been interested in video production, and have been producing videos since I was in elementary school. When I transferred to Norwood High School during my Sophomore year, I immediately joined the program. </p>
			<p>Once at the high school, I began working on producing many journalism stories and sports highlights. Towards the end of my Sophomore year, I began getting involved in the daily live news broadcast, which went out to the entire school. Here, I began by doing teleprompter, camera, audio, switching, and floor director. My junior year, I began being a regular host on the news, as well as a host on the monthly video segment Mustang Magazine, which was a show that compiled the best stories from the entire television program. </p>
			<p>Over the years, I competed in numerous competitions for the Student Television Network. They would host competitions over the school year where students must produce a story based on a certain topic over the span of 5 days. I also competed in the competition that was hosted at the Student Television Network convention, where my school competed against many other schools from across the nation, as well as some from outside. </p>

			<h1><u><center>About</center></u></h1>
			<p><img src="me.jpg" alt="Prom, 2016" title="Me at senior prom, 2016" width="177" height="294.3" align="right"/>
			I am a Computer Science major at Worcester Polytechnic Institute, on track for a Bachelors of Science Degree, with a strong interest in pursuing cyber security or software engineering. I am currently a Sophomore and on track to graduate in May of 2020. </p> 
			<p>Throughout my life, I have had a passion for computers, following in the steps of my father. Computers have always been a big part of my life, and figuring out how they and the software works has been an interest of mine since I was a child. I did not begin programming until my senior year of high school, but I always have known I have wanted to do it.</p>
			<p>Alongside my interest in computers, I also have a strong interest in video production and film. For just about the same time I found myself interested in computers, I found myself interested in making videos. I have been producing videos for most of my life, and utilized that skill throughout high school, being a part of the daily morning news team and winning several awards for my journalism stories.</p>
			<img src="baseball.jpg" alt="Baseball, 2014" title="JV Game against Dedham, 2014" width="173" height="190.4" align="right"/>
			<p>Another passion I have is for sports. I have played baseball for nearly the enitrety of my life and have always had a love for it. I have also played football and basketball, but my favorite has always been (and will be) baseball. I was a part of the 2015 Massachusetts Division I State Championship team in high school, as well as the 2nd place 2014 Division I State Championship team. I cotinued to play up until my final year of eligibility in American Legion Baseball for the Post 70 Norwood team.</p>
