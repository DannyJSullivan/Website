			<h1><center style="margin-top: 3%">Video Production</center></h1>
			<p>In high school, I heavily participated in the school's television program. I have always been interested in video production, and have been producing videos since I was in elementary school. When I transferred to Norwood High School during my Sophomore year, I immediately joined the program. </p>
			<p>Once at the high school, I began working on producing many journalism stories and sports highlights. Towards the end of my Sophomore year, I began getting involved in the daily live news broadcast, which went out to the entire school. Here, I began by doing teleprompter, camera, audio, switching, and floor director. My junior year, I began being a regular host on the news, as well as a host on the monthly video segment Mustang Magazine, which was a show that compiled the best stories from the entire television program. </p>
			<p>Over the years, I competed in numerous competitions for the Student Television Network. They would host competitions over the school year where students must produce a story based on a certain topic over the span of 5 days. I also competed in the competition that was hosted at the Student Television Network convention, where my school competed against many other schools from across the nation, as well as some from outside. </p>

			<p>Along with my school work, I also have been volunteering and working for Norwood Public Access Television as a freelance video producer for them. I film and edit many different events, such as sports, meetings, concerts, and speakers to name a few.
